# docker-pyde1
Docker container for PyDE1

This is under continous development.

If it breaks, it breaks.

I didn't even create a dev branch, so I think this should ring some bells.

## TODO
 1. Check why pyde1 mqtt user gets DENIED when writing to pyDE1/#
 2. Is bluetooth even working ?
 3. Check nginx and pyde1 container to share data
 4. Why is pyde1 still exposing port 80 & 443 ?

 ..

 99. Clean up
