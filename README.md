# docker-pyde1
Docker compose for PyDE1, mosquitto and nginx.

This is under continous development.

If it breaks, it breaks.

I didn't even create a dev branch, so I think this should ring some bells.

A lot of credit to [jeffsf](https://github.com/jeffsf/pyDE1) and [tobbenb](https://github.com/tobbenb/docker-pyde1), for the base of all this.

## TODO
 1. Is bluetooth even working ?
 2. Check nginx and pyde1 container to share data

 ..

 99. Clean up
